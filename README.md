# C-Task
## Concept i have used
I define a function called myprintf( ) that takes a format string and a variable number of arguments. The va_list variable args is used to hold the variable arguments, and is initialized using the va_start() function. The vprintf( ) function is then used to output the formatted string with the provided arguments. Finally, the va_end() function is called to clean up the va_list.

When we call the myprintf() function with a format string and variables, it behaves just like the printf() function, outputting the formatted string to the console.
